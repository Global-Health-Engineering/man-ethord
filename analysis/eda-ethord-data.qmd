# Overview

This document presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the ETH Board Open Research Data (ORD) Program dataset. The program represents a CHF 15 million ETH domain initiative dedicated to increasing the visibility and impact of research within the scientific community, economy, and society.

## Data Resources in the ethord Package

The `ethord` package contains **11 datasets** organized into three main categories:

### Application-Phase Data (6 datasets)

1. **`application_metadata`** (76 projects × 15 variables)
   - Core project information: project IDs, categories, titles, abstracts
   - Main applicant details: institution, function, name, location
   - Project timeline: start dates, duration (4-36 months)
   - Budget: total requested amounts (CHF 15,000 - 1,500,000)

2. **`application_budget`** (78 projects × 16 variables)
   - Detailed budget breakdown by personnel category (senior staff, postdocs, students)
   - Travel, equipment, and publication fees
   - Subcontracting costs
   - Project phase indicator (1 or 2)

3. **`application_ethics`** (76 projects × 25 variables)
   - 24 binary ethics flags covering:
     - Human subjects research (embryos, participants, interventions, clinical studies)
     - Data handling (personal data, export/import, criminal records)
     - Animal research
     - International activities and equity considerations
     - Environmental impact and endangered species
     - AI ethics considerations

4. **`application_metadata_applicants`** (113 co-applicants × 7 variables)
   - Co-applicant information by project
   - Institution, function, names, location

5. **`application_metadata_keywords`** (303 keywords × 3 variables)
   - Research keywords by project (0-10 keywords per project)
   - Topics include: Data Processing, Visualization, Machine Learning, FAIR data

6. **`application_metadata_work_packages`** (273 work packages × 4 variables)
   - Work package identifiers and titles by project
   - Project structure and planned activities

### Reporting-Phase Data (3 datasets)

7. **`report_metadata`** (63 reports × 10 variables)
   - Project reporting information
   - Report type (Final, Intermediate, other)
   - Reporting periods and project dates
   - Main applicant details

8. **`report_output`** (1,033 outputs × 6 variables)
   - Project outputs categorized by type:
     - Estimated users (quantity: 0-75,000)
     - Datasets/databases published
     - Outreach activities
   - Descriptions and URLs for outputs

9. **`report_metadata_coapplicants`** (132 co-applicants × 6 variables)
   - Co-applicant contributions in reports
   - Roles and main tasks

### Mapping Data (1 dataset)

10. **`project_mapping`** (76 projects × 5 variables)
    - Links project IDs to document paths
    - Project categories and acronyms

## Project Categories

Three funding categories exist with different budget levels:

- **Contribute**: CHF 30,000 - Small-scale open data projects
- **Explore**: CHF 150,000 - Medium exploration projects
- **Establish**: CHF 1,500,000 - Large infrastructure establishment

# Data Preparation

```{r setup}
#| message: false
library(ethord)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)

# Set default ggplot theme
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

# Reproduction: Projects by Institution and Category

This reproduces the original visualization showing the distribution of funded projects across ETH domain institutions and project categories.

```{r fig-institutions}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6
#| warning: false

  mutate(category = case_when(
    project_category == "Contribute" ~ "Contribute (30k)",
    project_category == "Explore" ~ "Explore (150k)",
    project_category == "Establish" ~ "Establish (1.5m)"
  )) |>
  mutate(category = factor(category,
                           levels = c("Contribute (30k)",
                                      "Explore (150k)",
                                      "Establish (1.5m)"))) |>
  count(main_applicant_institution, category) |>
  mutate(main_applicant_institution = str_wrap(main_applicant_institution, width = 30)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(main_applicant_institution, n),
             y = n,
             fill = category)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  geom_label(aes(label = n),
             position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
             show.legend = FALSE,
             color = "white",
             fontface = "bold",
             size = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(

    subtitle = "Number of funded projects per institution of lead applicant and project category",
    y = "Number of projects",
    x = NULL,
    fill = "Project category:"
  ) +
  scale_fill_colorblind() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
